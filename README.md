Description

## Getting Started

- The original project cloned for the microservice is a simple Node.js REST Server
- Simply `npm install` from the microservice root to install its dependancies
- Don't forget to make sure the Docker daemon is running before trying to test the image

## My Approach

- This project outlines two specific files that are required as part of the image composition, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (note the .yml extension, a data serialisation language for our instructions)
- I have set up the project's microservice deps and left blank files for the Docker configuration for the initial commit
- The next step is to push the developed branches to dev and get to work on the docker configuration
